# FCM-181_MicroThisMicroThat



This is the repository for my Micro This Micro That article in Full Circle Magazine # 181.

It deals with the Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller and a 24 LED NeoPixel ring to show (eventually) the heading from a LSM303 Sensor.  This is a continuation of the article in FCM-179.
